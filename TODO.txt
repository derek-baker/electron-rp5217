- add accordions to open modal (one should open file dialog, one should load from localStorage)

- may be a bug existing due to vue instance data props not being populated with localstorage keys

- consider creating parent components for navbar, and replicating it at the bottom

- user needs to know what form they currently have "open" if any

- user needs a confirmation message when they've saved successfully
